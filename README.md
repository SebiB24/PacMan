# Pac-Man Game in Java


## 🎮 About the Game
This is a simple **Pac-Man clone** built using **Java and Swing**. The game features a classic **grid-based movement system**, ghosts with randomized movement, collectible food items, and a score system. The goal is to **collect all the food items** while avoiding ghosts. If you lose all your lives, the game is over!

## 🛠️ Features
✅ Classic Pac-Man movement system
✅ Ghost AI with randomized movement
✅ Collision detection with walls and ghosts
✅ Score system
✅ Game restart on game over
✅ Simple but fun gameplay experience

## 🚀 How to Run
### **Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later)
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support

## 🔧 How it Works
The game uses **Java Swing** for rendering and **KeyListeners** for handling input. The logic includes:
- **Pac-Man movement** with collision detection against walls
- **Ghosts move randomly**, changing direction when hitting walls
- **Food disappears** when Pac-Man eats it, increasing the score
- **Game restarts** when all food is eaten or if Pac-Man loses all lives

## 🏗️ Future Improvements
🔹 More advanced ghost AI with pathfinding
🔹 Power-ups (e.g., temporary ghost immunity)
🔹 Animated Pac-Man and ghost sprites
🔹 Sound effects and music
